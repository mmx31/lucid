The app module is what handles applications in lucid.

Launching apps
==============

By system name
--------------
To launch apps by system name, we can use ``desktop.app.launch()``:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    desktop.app.launch("FileManager");

We can also provide arguments for this application if we want:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    desktop.app.launch("FileManager", {path: "public://"});

Launch an app to edit a file
----------------------------
The method ``desktop.app.launchHandler()`` can be used to launch an app that can be used to edit/view a file:

.. code-block:: javascript
    
    desktop.app.launchHandler("file://foo/bar.txt", {someArg: "someValue"});

If we don't specify arguments, the file's path will be passed as the only argument. If arguments *are* passed, then the file's path will be added to the provided arguments.

Launch an app based on mimetype
-------------------------------
If we want to launch an app that can edit/view a file with a certain mimetype, then we can pass this to ``desktop.app.launchHandler()``:

.. code-block:: javascript

   desktop.app.launchHandler(null, {}, "text/plain");

If we specify a file's path rather then ``null``, then the method won't need to request the file's mimetype from the server.

Launch the web browser
----------------------
We can use ``launchHandler()`` to launch the installed web browser as well. We could launch the WebBrowser app directly using ``launch()``, but there's no guarantee that the app is installed, or if the user has that specified as the default web-browsing app. So, we'll use the "text/x-uri" mimetype to do this cleanly.

.. code-block:: javascript

   desktop.app.launchHandler(null, {url: "http://www.lucid-desktop.org/"}, "text/x-uri");
