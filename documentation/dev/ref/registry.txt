    :synopsis: Use the registry to store application data

Lucid's registry is basically a persistant dojo.data store that apps can use to store data. This can be used to store application settings, and other data. For example, I cold use the Registry to store contacts in a contacts application.

Creating a registry
===================
To create a registry, we need to specify our application's name, the store's name, and any initial data we want if the store doesn't exist yet.

.. code-block:: javascript

   var store = new desktop.Registry({
       name: "contacts",
       appname: this.sysname,
       data: {
           identifier: "id",
           items: [
               {id: 0, name: "Foo Barson"},
               {id: 1, name: "Bar Fooson"}
               // etc.
           ]
       }
   });

If the store exists on the server, then it will load the data. If it doesn't, then it will use the initial data that was supplied when it was created.

Reading and writing with the registry
=====================================
Reading and writing to a registry store works just like any other ``dojo.data`` store. See `Dojo's documentation`_. for more info on dojo.data stores.

Registry operations
===================

Saving data
-----------
To save the data in the store, use the ``save`` method. You must save the store once you are finished adding and removing items from the store. This works the same as the ``save`` method defined in the dojo.data write api.

.. code-block:: javascript

    store.save();

Checking if a store exists
--------------------------
To see if a store exists, use the ``exists`` method. It takes three arguments: the first being a callback function, the second being an error callback, and the third being a boolean. If the third argument is set to ``true``, then the request to the server is syncronous.

.. code-block:: javascript

    store.exists(function(e) {
        desktop.dialog.notify(e ? "Store exists" : "Store doesn't exist");
    });

Dropping a store
----------------
If you want to delete the store's contents on the server, use the ``drop`` method. It takes an optional callback as the first parameter, and an optional error callback as the second argument. After the store is dropped, it will act as if it never existed.

.. code-block:: javascript

    store.drop(function(e) {
       desktop.dialog.notify("dropped the store!");
    });
